    <h1>What is iGEM?</h1>
    <p>iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) is a competition that challenges students from universities all around the world to solve local and global problems with synthetic biology. At the end of each year, iGEM teams travel to Paris to defend the scientific merit and community impact of their projects.

    <h1>UMaryland iGEM</h1>
    <p>UMaryland iGEM is a team of undergraduate students at the University of Maryland, College Park that compete in iGEM annually. Our organization is student run - we develop a project idea, conduct wet lab and computational research, meet with stakeholders to get feedback, fundraise to support our team, and promotional materials to display our research. UMaryland iGEM is a great opportunity for students to learn both technical and communication skills, all while gaining experience in many aspects of the research process. In the past, our team has worked on projects relating to plastic degradation, the banana plight, methane pollution, and the bioremediation of phosphorus and nitrogen in the Chesapeake Bay.
